## 🧠 What is Cognize?

Cognize is a rupture-aware cognition control engine. It simulates, logs, and governs cognitive drift, memory misalignment, and hallucination in LLMs or recursive agents.

Rather than correcting hallucinations after the fact, Cognize:

- Detects **epistemic drift** and **rupture**
- Tracks **E(t)**: memory of misalignment
- Computes **Θ(t)**: rupture threshold
- Mutates reception R(t) when rupture occurs (simulating hallucination)
- Provides an **RCCMonitor** class to observe LLM behavior across time

---

## ✅ Features

- Scalar or semantic drift modes
- Modular RCC engine (`RCC`, `RCCMonitor`)
- Post-rupture mutation control
- SavePoint trace log
- Embedding-agnostic architecture (plug OpenAI, HF, or local)

---

## 📦 Install

```bash
pip install cognize  # once published
# OR
pip install -e .  # for local development
```

---

## 🧱 Architecture

```python
from cognize import RCCMonitor

monitor = RCCMonitor(mode="scalar")
status = monitor.observe(prompt="Define entropy", response="Entropy is reverse order")

if status['rupture']:
    print("⚠️ Rupture detected")
```
